# Functions

In N, functions are a type of value, like strings or lists. This means they
can be stored in variables or passed around as arguments for or return values
from another function.

As a preview for what this article entails, the following code defines a
function named `getPi` that takes a `()` (the unit type) and returns a float.
Then, `getPi` is called and printed.

```js
let getPi = [] -> float {
	return 3.141592653589793
}

print(getPi())
```

The above definition benefits from type inference and syntactic sugar. The
following code is a more verbose equivalent of the above example.

```js
let getPi: () -> float = [_: ()] -> float {
	return 3.141592653589793
}

print(getPi(()))
```

## Function expressions

The following is an example of a function expression. This alone does not make
the function expression usable; it needs to be stored somewhere before it can be
called.

```js
[a:float b:float] -> float {
	return (a^2 + b^2)^0.5
}
```

Function expressions start with a list of arguments, separated by spaces and
enclosed by square brackets. Each argument consists of a [definite
pattern](./destructuring.md), which can just be the argument name, followed by a
colon (`:`) then the type annotation of the argument. Note that unlike `let`
statements, argument type annotations cannot be inferred and thus are required.
In the example above, the function expression has two arguments: `a` and `b`,
both floats.

After the arguments, there is an arrow (`->`) and then the return type
annotation. Like the function arguments, the return type annotation cannot be
inferred and is thus also required. In the above example, the function returns a
float.

Then, after the return type is the body of the function: statements enclosed by
curly brackets (`{` and `}`).

**NOTE**: N supposedly has "anonymous function expressions" that use a colon
(`:`) after the return type. You would expect the documentation to document
this, but there's not that much information on it even for the people writing
this, and it seems the implementations don't agree on it. There're also no tests
specifying its behavior and syntax.

Functions are required to `return` a value with the proper type by the end of
the function.

### Syntactic sugar for `()`

If the function expression has no arguments, the function is assumed to take a
`()`, a unit value.

```ts
assert type [] -> int {
	return 3
} : () -> int
```

A function with a return type of `()` or `cmd[()]` does not need a `return`
statement. There is an implicit `return ()` at the end of the function for
convenience. The following example is valid, despite the function expression
lacking an explicit `return` statement.

```js
[] -> () {
	print("Hello")
}
```

**NOTE**: The above function may be optimized and never called during runtime
because its return value is known at compile time (unit types only have one
possible value during runtime).

### Declaring functions

Unlike many programming languages, N does not have a special syntax for
declaring functions. Instead, you can store the function in a variable like with
any other value using a `let` statement. You can take advantage of type inference to avoid redundantly listing types.

The following code declares a function `add` that takes two integers and returns
an integer.

```ts
let add = [a:int b:int] -> int {
	return a + b
}
```

## Calling functions

In the `add` example above, `add` in reality is a function that takes an
integer, then returns another function that takes another integer before
returning an integer. This is called **currying**; in N, all functions are
curried, so functions will take one argument at a time.

Thus, it is perfectly valid to only give one argument to `add` for **partial
application**.

```ts
let addOne = add(1)
```

`addOne` is a function that takes a single integer and returns the integer
incremented by one.

```js
assert value addOne(3) == 4
assert value addOne(-2) == -1
```

Currying and partial application are useful for creating more specific functions
that can operate on values with certain options preset. For this reason, it is
good practice in N to have any options arguments as the first arguments for a
function, then the value to transform as the last argument.

The built-in function `itemAt` is a good example of this practice. It takes an
index first, then the list. Thus, a more specific function that gets the first
or second item of a list can be easily defined by only supplying an index to the
`itemAt`.

```js
let first = itemAt(0)
let second = itemAt(1)
```

### Type annotations

To demonstrate that functions with multiple arguments actually take one argument
at a time and then return another function, the type annotation of the `add`
function from above is `int -> (int -> int)`.

```ts
assert type add : int -> int -> int
```

**NOTE**: The parentheses are optional if the return type of a function is
another function. However, if the argument type is a function, then parentheses
are needed. For example, `str -> (str -> str)` is a function that takes two
strings, while `(str -> str) -> str` is a function that takes another function
that takes a string.

Here are a few other examples with other functions defined in the examples
above. Some of these type annotations use type variables, which you can read
about at [Type variables](./generic.md).

```ts
assert type [a:float b:float] -> float {
	return (a^2 + b^2)^0.5
} : float -> float -> float

assert type [] -> () {
	print("Hello")
} : () -> ()

assert type addOne : int -> int

assert type first : [t] list[t] -> maybe[t]
assert type second : [t] list[t] -> maybe[t]
```

**TL;DR**: You can think of function type annotations as `[argument 1] -> [argument 2] -> ... -> [return type]`.

### Calling functions with multiple arguments at once

`substring` is a built-in function that takes a start index (inclusive), end
index (exclusive), then a string to slice.

Since functions are curried, it is possible to give all three arguments to
`substring` like the following:

```js
assert value substring(1)(3)("sheep") == "he"
```

However, having to surround each argument with parentheses is quite cumbersome
and verbose. N provides syntactic sugar for passing multiple arguments to a
function at once in sequence by separating each argument with a comma. This is
similar to C-style function calling used by a few programming languages, so
users of those languages should be familiar with this syntax.

```js
assert value substring(1, 3, "sheep") == "he"
```

#### More syntactic sugar with `()`

If a function takes a `()`, you can call a function passing in the `()` by
simply doing `functionName()` instead of `functionName(())`.

### Immediately invoked function expressions

In some cases, you may want to declare a temporary variable in an expression
context. Immmediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs) can be used to
include multiple statements and return a value.

```js
let deltaXSquared = [] -> float {
	let deltaX = x1 - x2
	return deltaX * deltaX
}()

// Alternative

let deltaXSquared = () |> [] -> float {
	let deltaX = x1 - x2
	return deltaX * deltaX
}
```

**NOTE**: Some implementations require parentheses around function expressions
when used like this.

This pattern is especially useful for creating a `cmd[()]` to export as the main
command for an N program.

```js
import times

let pub main = [] -> cmd[()] {
	print("Wait a second...")
	times.sleep(1000)!
	print("Thanks.")
}()
```

See [Procedures](./async.md) for more information on commands.
