# Type Aliases

Type aliases are great ways of compressing types into a more friendly form for usage in functions and other type declarations. It can be used as so:

```js
// This will create a simple alias for a record type
alias test = {
	a:int,
	b:int,
	c:str,
}

let test2 = (val:test) {
	print(val.b)
}
```

Here it may not seem that useful but when dealing with many different complex records and functions it is very useful to help figure out the types for everything. The `websocket` library uses this to help it make itself a bit more consise

```js
import websocket // Used for connecting to WebSockets
let websocketTest = websocket.connect({
  onOpen: (send: websocket.send) -> cmd[bool] {
    print("Open!")
    send("hi")!
    return false
  },
  onMessage: (send: websocket.send, message: str) -> cmd[bool] {
    print(message)
    send("hello")!
    return message == "hello"
  }
}, "wss://echo.websocket.org")!
```

In this example `websocket.send` is actually a type alias for `str -> cmd[()]`. Here it is small, but it is also useful for changing the type of many different, similar records if changes are needed, such as a `user` record to add another field, as it would be impractical and problematic to do it by hand.

## Notes:

- When printing out the type of a value that uses an alias as its type, it will not print out the alias' name.
